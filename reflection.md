What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

To do this assignment, it is super helpful to watch the videos to understand what to do, and use the main.py and other provided files to help complete your own code. I definitely found it helpful to refer to the procedural code while attempting to write the resale shop in object-oriented programming. It was definitely challenging to get the formatting exactly right, as well as working out how to use a class within another class. I would recommend really going over the procedural code in-depth to fully understand the purpose of each function and writing pseudocode to transform the procedural functions in object-oriented functions.
